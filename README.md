Network Traffic Simulator for Telecom

A real-time network traffic simulator designed for telecommunications companies to visualize and analyze network performance. Built with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend, featuring live data updates via WebSocket connections.

Features

- **Real-time Network Visualization**: Interactive SVG-based topology display with 5 interconnected nodes (A, B, C, D, E)
- **Dynamic Statistics**: Live updates of packet counts, latency, throughput, and loss rates
- **Packet Routing**: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for optimal packet routing
- **Congestion Control**: Queue management with configurable capacity limits
- **Interactive Controls**: Start/pause/reset simulation with adjustable parameters
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive analytics dashboard with exportable data
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication between client and server
